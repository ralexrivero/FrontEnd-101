## Frameworks and libraries

Frameworks and libraries are tools that are used to make the development of web pages easier. They are tools that are used to make the development of web pages easier and faster. They are tools that are used to make the development of web pages easier and faster and more reliable. They are tools that are used to make the development of web pages easier and faster and more reliable and more secure.

Frameworks provides a structure for developers to build with.

Frameworks are considered opinionated and libraries are considered unopinionated. Frameworks are a great way to reduce development time and to enforme a structure on how code is written. They have many best practices already in place and contain most of what is needed to develop an application. They are a great way to get started with a project.

## Api and services

API is the acronym for application programming interface, it is a set of functions and procedures that allows the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application or other service.

Some common API's are API REST, API, and Sensor-Based API.
Api's are used to connect applications to other applications, are often the bridge between different componentes or systems. Well known by names like gateway, middleware, or connector.

RESTfull or RESTful API's are a type of API that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. Stand for REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
The API's use endpoints to specify how different resources can be accessed. The endpoints are the URLs that are used to access the API's.  The endpoints are the URLs that are used to access the API's and the HTTP methods that are used to access the API's.

## IDE

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that is used to write and test code. It is a software application that is used to write and test code for a specific programming language. It is a software application that is used to write and test code for a specific programming language and operating system. It is a software application that is used to write and test code for a specific programming language and operating system and hardware.

An IDE is software for building applications, it's like a text editor but with more features and insted of writing code you can use a graphical interface to build your application. It's a tool that helps you to write code faster and more efficiently.

There are many IDE's for different programming languages and operating systems. Some of the most popular IDE's are Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Brackets, etc. Some are specific for a programming language while others suppor many languages.

Some features is syntax highlighting, code completion, code refactoring, debugging, version control, etc.
With syntax higlighting the code is color coded to make it easier to read and understand. Code completion is a feature that helps you to write code faster by suggesting what you are typing. Code refactoring is a feature that helps you to write code faster by suggesting what you are typing and by making changes to the code. Debugging is a feature that helps you to write code faster by suggesting what you are typing and by making changes to the code and by finding errors in the code. Version control is a feature that helps you to write code faster by suggesting what you are typing and by making changes to the code and by finding errors in the code and by keeping track of changes to the code.
Error highlighting  can highlight mistakes in the code, like misspelled words, missing symbols, etc.

A web developer is a person that is used to create web pages that are written in HTML and CSS and Javascript and PHP.

Libraries are reusable pieces of ode that can be used by your application. They are purpose-built to provide a specific functionality. A developer access the functionality of a library by calling a function or method, as a result they can have more time to focus on the application development.
